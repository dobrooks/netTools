## Getting Started

NetTools is meant to be a base to which to build. Although it does not use a database for storing 
space data adding one should be as simple of replacing the crud file with your own database methods.

NetTools uses a json file to store a limited set of space data which is loaded on startup and rewriten on new space adds and removals.
Its simple but limited.
